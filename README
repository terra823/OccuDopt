Sketch of a social network for occupy wallstreet / everywhere sponsorship and adoption.  When spending time in several of the occupy sites, we noted that 

*disconnects can occur between donations, comfort committee, and needs of occupiers
*some occupiers wanted an "angel" to help them, while others didn't
*groups (i.e. veterans for peace) wanted to know who was supporting their message in the field
*occupiers wanted resources (information, support) from groups (veterans for peace)
*many americans sympathetic to #OWS could not attend in person (kids, job, jail) but would like to help
*not everyone who wants to help wants to donate to the central account

Thus, Lauren Slowik and Matthew Wilse proposed OccuDopt, a social network for #OWS that would bind occupiers with patrons.

Navit and Brian are also in the house.
Stephanie and Amira are here too!
